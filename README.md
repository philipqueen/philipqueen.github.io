A simple personal site showcasing what I'm up to. 

## Site Design

The goal of this site is to make a simple static site without a static site generator. The static site is free to host (perfect for a rarely viewed personal site) and easy to maintain. Since updates are rare, converting Markdown posts to HTML through a ready made tool is easy. Code repitition is prevented by using very minimal client side JavaScript to generate the header. This no-dependencies JavaScript also allows toggling to dark mode. GitHub Pages handles the backend automatically (so I'm potentially sneaking in a Jekyll dependency).Minimal boilerplate and no dev tools means I spend time focused on content, not recreating my dev environment after 6 months away. Running it is as simple as `python -m http.server`. KISS, Gene Simmons style.
